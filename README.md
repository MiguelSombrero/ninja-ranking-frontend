# Ninja Ranking (frontend)

Ninja Ranking is my personal project made for my friend. It's a web application for keeping track of [Ninja Warrior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ninja_Warrior) tournaments. You can create Ninja Warrior tournament, add players and obstacles, and compete with each other. This app keeps track of players performances and shows some data etc.
