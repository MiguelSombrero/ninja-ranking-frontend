# Ninja Ranking (frontend)

*This app is on (very slow) development*

Ninja Ranking is my personal project made for my friend. It's a web application for keeping track of [Ninja Warrior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ninja_Warrior) tournaments. You can create Ninja Warrior tournament, add players and obstacles, and compete with each other. This app keeps track of players performances and shows some data etc. 

**More info and install instructions** can be found in [Ninja Ranking backend](https://github.com/MiguelSombrero/ninja-ranking-backend) repository.
